1. Roll Dice Button (GUI Button click)

	Why it's necessary: This triggers the core game mechanicâ€”determining the direction the player moves. The dice roll introduces chance and guides 	gameplay, so a button to simulate this action is critical for player interaction and turn progression.

2. Reroll (GUI Button click)

	Why it's necessary: I decided that this game needs more player agency in order to be engaging, so each player should have a finite number of 	rerolls, which they will be prompted to use once they roll.

3. Restart Game or Reset Board Button (GUI Button click)

	Why it's necessary: Since the goal is to "fall off" the board, players will eventually reach the end. A reset option is necessary to allow 	replayability, testing, and iterative playthroughs, especially in a prototype where quick restarts are key for debugging and feedback.
